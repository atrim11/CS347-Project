This is the final project for CS347. It was a group project with:<br>
Aidan Trimmer @atrim11<br>
Eric Hernandez-Diaz @herna4er<br>
Jonathan Wist @JonathanWist<br>
Alden Geipel @Myradose<br>

The goal of the project was to make a full stack functioning website that had 2 different users, could access a database, add, update, and remove from that database.<br>
Our project is a social media workout tracking site called FitNation. <br>
To view the site go to http://aidantrimmer.com/FitNation/#  <br>
  To get started, once on the site click on sign up, then you fill in the information that is needed. <br>
  Then you are directed to the feed page where you can: see the posted workouts, like a workout, or comment on a workout.<br>
  You can also update your personal info from the top right user button.<br>
  To look for workout suggestions, go back to the feed page and click suggested workouts on the leftside of the page.<br>
  Then you can select from the dropdown menu based on the body area you are looking to work out, and click that button.<br>
  After you have a plan for your workout you can go back to the feedpage and post the workout you want to do or post after you have completed it.<br>
